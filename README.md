In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard..

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of `node/Git`
* You have a `Windows/Linux/Mac` machine. State which OS is supported.

## Installing Would You Rather

Windows/Linux and macOS:
* Download or Run git clone https://github.com/nchathu2014/would-you-rather-project.git to clone this repository.
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* Start the development server with `npm start`.
* App can be seen at: http://localhost:3000.

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### Users

| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.
