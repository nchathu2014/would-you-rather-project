In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the ‚ÄúWould You Rather?‚Äù game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: ‚ÄúWould you rather [option A] or [option B] ?‚Äù. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven‚Äôt answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard..

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of `node/Git`
